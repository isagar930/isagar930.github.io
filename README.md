## Recommended Websites
One of my favorite websites to visit when I'm bored, is [MapCrunch](https://www.mapcrunch.com/). This website navigates to random streets around the world and allows you to move around and explore the surroundings. You can discover new places around the world and get a closer look of life and views around the world.  
The website I visit most often is [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). Everyday, I log on to complete my lessons for the day as I learn French. Duolingo provides fun activities and different lessons to encourage learning a new language, including a leaderboard and streaks.

# Guessing Mermaid Diagram
In order to play our guessing game, there are a few steps to follow. Begin by pulling up our game. The computer will randomly select a number while you make your first numerical guess between the range given. The application will give you feedback and will let you know if your guess was too high, too low, or correct! If your guess was too low, that's okay! Proceed to make a second guess, aiming for a higher number this time. However, if your guess was too high, that's alright as well. Now, aiming for a lower number, make a second guess. Repeat this process until you guess the number correctly! Have fun playing!
