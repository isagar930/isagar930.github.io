## Recommended Websites
[MapCrunch](https://www.mapcrunch.com/)  One of my favorite websites to visit when I'm bored, is MapCrunch. This website navigates to random streets around the world and allows you to move around and explore the surroundings. You can discover new places around the world and get a closer look of life and views around the world.
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) The website I visit most often is Duolingo. Everyday, I log on to complete my lessons for the day as I learn French. Duolingo provides fun activities and different lessons to encourage learning a new language, including a leaderboard.
