## Recommended Websites
One of my favorite websites to visit when I'm bored, is [MapCrunch](https://www.mapcrunch.com/). This website navigates to random streets around the world and allows you to move around and explore the surroundings. You can discover new places around the world and get a closer look of life and views around the world.  
The website I visit most often is [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). Everyday, I log on to complete my lessons for the day as I learn French. Duolingo provides fun activities and different lessons to encourage learning a new language, including a leaderboard and streaks.
